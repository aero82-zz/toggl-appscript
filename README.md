# toggl-appscript
Google App Script for Toggl API to generate your own reports in Google Sheets

## Overview
Toggle is a great app for tracking your time but their reports 
make it hard to track progress over more than a week.

Fortunately they have a decent [API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs)
This code makes it easy to download your results daily and use whatever
methods you want for graphing and sharing in Google Sheets.

## Usage
1) Start a new document from template from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13xi5_uUYTuIhvwdw7fUJxGGUwGTYEezQ5rX8BMypKEU/)
2) In Google Sheets go to Tools > Script Editor
3) Copy/paste the code from toggle_appscript.js
4) Put in your API token and Project names in the indicated places
5) Run manually or setup a Trigger to run automatically
